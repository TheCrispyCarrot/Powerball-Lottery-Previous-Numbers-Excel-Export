# Powerball-Lottery-Previous-Numbers-Excel-Export

This is a program that pulls all the wining Powerball lottery numbers from https://www.lottery.net/powerball/numbers
and exports them into an excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet contains the weekday, date, and month of the win as well 
as each individual ball and the power play. Each row of data has its own unique id. (what you do with this data is 
up to you)

In order to run this program yourself, you will have to insert your browser headers that can be found by typing
